            <h2>Check Your Saved Login Information</h2>
            <p>
                If you have previously signed in to your Yahoo email account on a device or browser,
                your email address may be saved in the browser settings or password manager.
                Check your saved credentials in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.

            <h2>Search Your Emails from Other Accounts</h2>
            <p>
                Look through emails from other email accounts you use. Yahoo often sends
                verification messages, security alerts, or welcome emails that contain your
                Yahoo email address.

        <section>
            <h2>Use Yahoo Account Recovery</h2>
            <p>
                Visit the Yahoo sign-in helper page and choose the option to recover your account.
                You can enter your recovery phone number or alternate email address to find your
                Yahoo email account.

            <h2>Check Devices Where You Signed In Before</h2>
            <p>
                If you have used Yahoo Mail on a smartphone, tablet, or desktop email app,
                open the mail settings on that device to view the configured Yahoo email address.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Contact Yahoo Support</h2>
            <p>
                If none of the above methods work, Yahoo Support can guide you through the
                verification process to help locate your Yahoo email account securely.
